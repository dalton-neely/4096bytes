					<h2>Why Did I Create a Portfolio Website?</h2>
					<p>As I encountered my journey to become a software engineer, 
					I discovered that some of the top tier applicants had their own websites dedicated to their work.
					Moreover, I had an extra computer laying around that I hardly ever used. So I thought to myself,
					"why not set up a server at home, and run a website for free that shows off my abilities?" So I did,
					and you, the visitor, are likely here because you are determining if I am a suitable applicant for
					your company. I can't tell you if I would be the best applicant possible, but I do know that I 
					can give you one heck of a try. Consequently, take a look through this site an judge for yourself,
					but keep in mind that all my abilities can not be expressed through this site due to time constraints
					and the inability to transfer the human conscious into code.</p>
					<p>Sincerely,</p>
					<p>A Hard Worker</p>
